    {Full-stack web developer} % Job title
    {Salesforce, Inc} % Organization
    {San Francisco, California} % Location
    {June. 2021 - December 2021} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Wrote the full test-suite for Unit, Feature and Browser QA tests.}
        \item {Developed and maintained CI/CD pipeline on GitHub with actions and Heroku deployments as well as review apps on branches connecting everything to Jira development board.}
        \item {Audited and mitigated unnoticed security advisories.}
        \item {Built Redis based queue system and moved long processing operations to background jobs.}
        \item {Worked on end-to-end features as part of a larger team, took responsibility of instantly pushing bug fixes as they arrive on Sentry and Bugsnag.}
        \item {Building campaign manager assets through Cloudinary API was dying in the background and it was hard to debug and tell what went wrong, I integrated Laravel Horizon \& a queue worker dyno on Heroku that immensely helped developers maintain a healthy codebase.}
        \item {Managers had the futile task of manually inviting users from Salesforce CRM to the campaign builder, I wrote a script to parse users export as CSV files, I created an admin panel where a manager can upload the CSV and it send out email invitations for people to register and because the project is deployed in the Heroku platform that Salesforce owns, I wrote a bash script to execute seeders and artisan commands on the release phase.}
        \item {Users leave their campaign builder form open in the office so I wrote a frontend code to detect inactivity and send an API request to auto logout and invalidate session (saving current unsubmitted work) at a configurable interval.}
        \item {Added a way for managers to flag users as (free access) so they don't get charged via Stripe.}
        \item {Sometimes logos get rendered incorrectly on top of certain backgrounds, I used Cloudinary API to intelligently invert or place the logo on a proper background.}
        \item {Certain developers and HTML designers kept on misspelling the brand name Salesforce, so I created a GitHub action that combs through the entire codebase and automatically correct the spelling with a bash script that uses grep and sed.}
